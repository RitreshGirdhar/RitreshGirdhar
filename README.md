🎯 **About Me**  
A results-driven **Tech Lead & Backend Engineer** with over **13+ years of experience** delivering high-performance, cloud-native, and AI-enhanced platforms. I specialize in **Spring Boot**, **Java**, **Python**, **Kafka**, and distributed system architecture. I’ve built software that scales to **millions of users**, optimized for performance, reliability, and observability.

🛠️ From architecting large-scale microservices to mentoring teams, and from hands-on coding to deploying production-grade apps on **AWS, GCP & OpenShift**, I love solving real-world problems with clean, pragmatic solutions.

📚 I'm passionate about sharing knowledge through writing and have authored several technical articles on **Medium** and **DZone**.
