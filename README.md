# Hi, I'm Ritresh Girdhar

I’m a backend-focused software engineer and tech lead with over 13 years of experience building scalable, cloud-native applications and data platforms.

I specialize in Spring Boot, Java, Python, and distributed system design, and have worked extensively across domains like e-commerce, fintech, and telecom. Most recently, I’ve led teams working on data engineering and real-time processing platforms deployed on GCP and OpenShift.

When I’m not building software, I write technical articles and share learnings from real-world systems and patterns.

## Articles

Here are a few technical write-ups I’ve published:

- [Change data capture using Debezium](https://ritresh-girdhar.medium.com/change-data-capture-using-debezium-ec48631d643a)

## Experience

Currently working as a Tech Lead at Citi, where I lead a team building microservices and data pipelines for ETL publishing and reporting. Before this, I was at Publicis Sapient and led efforts on large-scale e-commerce applications and real-time logistics integrations with third-party providers.

Over the years, I’ve worked with technologies like:

- Java, Kotlin, Python, Elixir
- Spring Boot, WebFlux, Reactor
- Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, BigQuery
- Apache Beam, Spark, Google Dataflow
- Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Jenkins, Terraform
- Monitoring with Prometheus, New Relic, Datadog
- GCP and AWS (EKS, Lambda, Pub/Sub, IAM, etc.)

I’ve also worked on AI/ML-driven applications using BERT, RoBERTa, CNNs, and LangChain.

## Interests

- Distributed systems and streaming data pipelines
- Cloud architecture and DevOps automation
- System observability and operational excellence
- Writing about real-world tech patterns and software design
